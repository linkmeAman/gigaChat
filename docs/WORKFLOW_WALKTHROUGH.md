# Workflow Walkthrough â€“ tests.yml

## What triggers it

- `on: push` to `master` and `aman` branches
- `on: pull_request` to `master` branch

## What it does

1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python (matrix: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
3. Install dependencies
4. Run tests with coverage
5. Upload coverage to Codecov
6. Store coverage HTML report as artifact
7. Verify coverage threshold (80%)

## Issues Found

- [ ] No permission specifications (too broad by default)
- [ ] Using floating action versions (@v2, @v3)
- [ ] No dependency caching
- [ ] No concurrency control (wastes resources)
- [ ] No timeout limits
- [ ] No artifact retention policy
- [ ] Python matrix includes older versions (3.8, 3.9)

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: Added explicit permissions
2. **Performance**:
   - Added concurrency control
   - Added dependency caching
   - Set job timeout
3. **Reliability**:
   - Pinned action versions to exact commits
   - Updated Python versions to modern ones
   - Added retention policy for artifacts
4. **UX**:
   - Added PYTHONPATH
   - Added version suffix to artifact names
   - Upload coverage even on test failure
