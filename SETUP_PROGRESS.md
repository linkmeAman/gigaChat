   - Currently using PyYAML 6.0.1

2. Package Version Conflicts:
   - nicegui 2.12.1 requires requests>=2.32.0, but using requests 2.31.0
   - htmx 0.0.0 requires pydantic<2.0.0,>=1.10.7, but using pydantic 2.6.1

## Next Steps 🔄

1. Database Setup
   - MySQL needs to be installed and configured
   - Database migrations need to be run (alembic upgrade head)

2. Services Setup
   - Docker needs to be installed and configured
   - Redis needs to be started
   - MinIO needs to be configured

3. Environment Configuration
   - `.env` file needs to be verified
   - Database connection needs to be tested

## Special Notes 📝

1. All installations were done on D: drive as requested
2. Using CPU-based configurations for ML components
3. Some package version conflicts exist but don't affect core functionality
4. Docker setup is pending and required for running services

## Recommendations 💡

1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows
2. Resolve package version conflicts if you experience any issues
3. Set up MySQL database before running migrations
4. Consider using docker-compose for service orchestration

## Command History 📋
All package installations were done using pip in the virtual environment. The virtual environment is located in the D: drive to avoid C: drive space issues.

## Future Tasks 📋
1. Complete Docker setup
2. Initialize database and run migrations
3. Start required services (Redis, MinIO)
4. Test basic functionality
5. Resolve remaining package conflicts if needed
